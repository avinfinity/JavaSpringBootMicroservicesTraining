Layered Architecture  
- Separation of Concerns
- In layered architecture components with similar functonalities are grouped together . As a result each layer performs specific role within the application
- Example could be - Repository (talk to DB), Service (business logic) etc.
- one layer should talk to other via interface 

Coupling - Degree to which one class knows about other 
high cohesion is expected
