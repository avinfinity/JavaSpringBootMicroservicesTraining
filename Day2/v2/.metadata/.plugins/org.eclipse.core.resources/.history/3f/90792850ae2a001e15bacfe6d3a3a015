- CURD Operation
We need to perform configuration with JDBC which is boiler plate code & we need to perform with every project 
In  order to remove this bolierplate code, we can use spring data JPA

Steps to use spring data jpa
1. Add database specific dependency 
2. Add spring data jpa dependency 
3. Configure DB specific properties using application properties file
4. Create an interface and extend it from Jparepository
5. Specify what is the type of entity we are working & which field is acting as primary key
6. Anotate entity class with appropriate JPA anotations 


Scale up specific microservices to be able to run multiple instances 
To make this, we can specify port as server.port=0 in the application.properties file

In OpenFeign interface we were adding hardcoded URL , which creates 2 problems
 - We do not know the port of coupoun service anymore
 - With hardcoding the URL load balancing will not happen. reuest will be send to only that service where port is hardcoded
 
 Hence, hard coding URL must be avoided
